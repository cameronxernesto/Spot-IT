This project focuses on training a YOLO model to detect and identify symbols on Spot-It cards. 
The goal is to enable automated recognition of all symbols on a given card image, useful for building AI-powered Spot-It gameplay tools or research in computer vision.
Currently, the accuracy of identifying the two same images on the spot it cards is 98.6%
